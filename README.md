# StormReplay Uploader
StormReplay Uploader is a Windows Service that uploads your [Heroes of the Storm](http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/) replays to different services.
The two main services are [HotsLogs](https://www.hotslogs.com/Default) and [Hero.gg](http://www.hero.gg/). But it is possible to add extra targets to this list.

# Configuration
When you run the installer it will automatically try to determine where your replays are located. You can manually change this path in the configuration file that is inside the installation folder you selected during installation.
You can open the StormReplayUploader.exe.config file in a text editor and change different settings for the service.
When you do make changes to this file you must restart the service, or your PC.
